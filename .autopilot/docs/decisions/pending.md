## How This Works

This file is automatically maintained by the AI assistant. When a decision requires your input:

1. AI adds it to the appropriate priority section below
2. You review and respond by checking an option
3. AI detects your response and takes action
4. Decision moves to `decisions/archive/YYYY-MM.md`

**Response Options:**
- Check `[x]` next to your chosen option
- Add notes in the "Your Notes" section if needed
- Save the file - AI will detect changes on next [Monitor] run
